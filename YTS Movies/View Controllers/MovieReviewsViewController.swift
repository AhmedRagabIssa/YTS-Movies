I wouldn't compare it to the Original movies with Angelina Jolie as it was just a different movie experience. I am still a fan of Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft but the Alicia Vikander version works too.")

After 30 minutes the production becomes completely predictable and starts following the cliche guidelines of an low budget movie designed to kill time for the average house wife. Despite Alicia Vikander's great performance going further the story becomes extremely boring, I assume sensed by the director, who decided to flood all milestones in it with too much drama and extremely irritating 80s-cheap-movie dramatic music. On top of everything else, the film deviates from the game story completely. Well, it is not a total wreck but if you have played the game and enjoyed it even a little, you do not need to suffer this glorified hiccup of a production.")

This movie had plenty of plot holes, the chosen Lara Croft was not the best choice and the CG in this trashy movie is cheap.")
